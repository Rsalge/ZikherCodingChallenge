Problem Statement:

Create a single-page JavaScaript app using React, and any other JavaScript packages you feel might be helpful (jQuery, Express/Hapi, etc).
The app interface should include a search input to get data from a public API (Spotify is an easy one: https://developer.spotify.com/web-api).
Display the data in a table, with functionality to toggle-sort the data in ascending or descending order by each category in the table header.
Post the code to a Github repository and host the app with a cloud service provider of your choice (AWS, Bluemix, Azure, Heroku, Github Pages, etc).
Send back links to the live demo, Github repo, and include some notes reflecting on each of the development choices you made for the app.

Bonus points:

Any UI/UX and design considerations.
Custom features (filters, ratings, comments, etc).
Preprocessors (Sass/Less, Haml, Typescript, Babel, Compass, etc).
Mobile compatibility (NativeScript).
Build systems and task runners (Gulp, Grunt, etc).
